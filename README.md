# Heaviest-K-Subgraph-Connected
Finding Heaviest K subgraph which are connected in Social Media

This project focuses on analysing important information using graphs and dense sub graphs from streamed data collected from dynamically changing social media network like Twitter. Twitter is fast emerging in recent years for users to post real time events. The challenge is to filter important real-life events as it is often bombarded by trivial ones referred as “babbles”.  
Objective of this project is to come out with an efficient algorithm to extract dense subgraphs that are connected from fast changing twitter data, with edges representing the co-occurrences of relevant events in tweets. The density of an induced subgraph is the number of edges contained in the subgraph, divided by the number of vertices [2]. This is then used to analyse important information like community detection, market survey of a product, trending topic etc. In such a graph, nodes represent relevant terms (such as countries, terms such as ’earthquake’, ’shooting’, etc), while each edge indicates whether the two corresponding terms co-occur together in tweets. Each edge is associated with a positive weight measuring the number of co-occurrences of the corresponding terms in tweets
